# Blueprint: 평행세계 인생 체험 서비스

## Overview

This project is the world's first "Parallel World Life Experience Service," an AI-powered life simulation website. It allows users to input their current information and explore alternative life paths based on different choices they could have made.

## Project Outline

### Design and Style

*   **Aesthetics:** Modern, clean, and visually engaging. The UI will be intuitive and user-friendly.
*   **Color Palette:** A futuristic and mysterious palette, primarily using deep blues, purples, and blacks, with contrasting bright colors for highlights and interactive elements.
*   **Typography:** A modern sans-serif font for readability, with a more stylized font for headings.
*   **Layout:** A single-page application layout. The main sections will be:
    *   **Hero Section:** A captivating title and a brief introduction to the service.
    *   **Input Section:** A form for users to input their current life information.
    *   **Simulation Results Section:** A section to display the generated parallel life paths.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.

### Features

*   **User Input Form:** A form to collect the user's current information, such as age, career, and key life decisions.
*   **AI-Powered Simulation:** A JavaScript-based simulation engine that generates alternative life scenarios based on user input.
*   **Dynamic Results Display:** The simulation results will be displayed in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.

## Current Plan

1.  **Create the basic HTML structure:** Set up the main sections of the website in `index.html`.
2.  **Apply modern and futuristic styling:** Style the website using `style.css` to create an immersive experience.
3.  **Implement the simulation logic:** Write the JavaScript code in `main.js` to handle user input and generate life simulations.
4.  **Refine and enhance:** Iteratively improve the design, features, and simulation logic based on feedback and testing.
