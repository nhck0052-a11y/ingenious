# Multiverse Life: AI Parallel World Life Simulator - Blueprint

## Project Overview

**Service Name:** 멀티버스 라이프 : AI 평행세계 인생 시뮬레이터 (Multiverse Life: AI Parallel World Life Simulator)

**Core Concept:** An interactive web service that allows users to experience hypothetical alternate life paths based on different choices, simulated by AI. It aims to provide a unique "parallel world experience" that encourages self-reflection and highlights the impact of life choices.

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike simple classification tests, this service generates a narrative-driven, personalized life simulation, offering a highly immersive and potentially viral experience.

## Detailed Outline: Style, Design, and Features

### 1. User Input (Current Information & Choices)

*   **User Profile:**
    *   Age
    *   Gender
    *   Major/Job
    *   Personality (e.g., via simple questionnaire or keyword input)
    *   Current Worries/Concerns
*   **Life-Changing Choice Scenarios:** Users will select from predefined "what if" scenarios:
    *   "다른 대학을 갔으면?" (What if I went to a different university?)
    *   "창업을 했으면?" (What if I started a business?)
    *   "해외로 나갔으면?" (What if I went abroad?)
    *   "공무원이 되었으면?" (What if I became a public servant?)
    *   "투자를 시작했으면?" (What if I started investing?)
    *   (Option to suggest a custom scenario - premium feature idea)

### 2. AI Simulation Output & Presentation

*   **Narrative Storyline:** A personalized, natural-language story of the simulated life path for 5, 10, and 20 years in the future.
*   **Data Report:**
    *   **Career:** Job, estimated annual salary.
    *   **Lifestyle:** Residential area, daily routine, hobbies.
    *   **Relationships:** Love and marriage story.
    *   **Major Life Events Timeline:** Key milestones and events presented chronologically.
*   **Visualizations:**
    *   **Illustrations/Images:** Placeholder images for future appearance, living environment, daily scenes. (Eventually to be generated by AI).
    *   **Infographics:** Simple charts/graphs for salary trends, lifestyle metrics.
*   **Shareable Content:**
    *   Card-style result image optimized for SNS sharing (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts).

### 3. Monetization Strategy (Future Expansion)

*   **Freemium Model:**
    *   **Free:** Basic simulation with one scenario and summary report.
    *   **Premium Features:**
        *   Detailed PDF life report.
        *   Multi-parallel world comparison.
        *   Specialized analysis (love, wealth, career).
        *   Longer-term simulations (e.g., 30, 40 years).
*   **B2B Expansion:** School career counseling, corporate HR talent analysis, career consulting.

### 4. Technical Approach (Placeholder for now)

*   **Frontend:** Vite + React (TypeScript), modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Web Components, CSS variables, ES Modules, async/await, fetch API). Mobile-responsive design.
*   **Backend (Future):**
    *   Large Language Models (LLM) for story generation.
    *   Probabilistic models and statistical algorithms for job, salary, lifestyle simulation.
    *   Image Generation AI for visual assets.
    *   Choice tree structure for multi-scenario generation.
*   **Hosting:** Firebase (for frontend hosting and potentially serverless functions).

### 5. UI/UX Principles

*   **Intuitive & Timeline-Centric:** Easy navigation to view life changes across 5, 10, 20 years.
*   **Visually Engaging:** Clean, modern aesthetic with a "multiverse" theme. Use of expressive typography, vibrant color palette, subtle textures, and multi-layered drop shadows (as per AI development guidelines).
*   **Interactive & Dynamic:** Buttons, sliders, and other UI components with elegant use of color and glow effects.
*   **Accessibility (A11Y):** Designed to be accessible to a wide range of users.
*   **Social Shareability:** Prominent SNS sharing features to drive virality.

### 6. High-Quality Site Principles (from AdSense articles) Applied

*   **User-Centric Design:** Every aspect from input to output will prioritize an engaging and meaningful user experience.
*   **Unique Content:** The narrative-driven simulation itself is the unique content.
*   **Clear Navigation:** Users will easily understand how to input information and interpret results.
*   **Quality over Quantity:** Focus on the depth and personalization of each simulation, even if it means fewer initial features.
*   **Value Proposition:** Clearly communicate the value of self-reflection and exploring choices.
*   **No Deceptive Practices:** All simulations will be presented as hypothetical scenarios.

## Current Requested Change & Plan for Implementation

The user has requested to create the "Multiverse Life: AI Parallel World Life Simulator" website.

**Plan for Current Implementation:**

1.  **Initialize/Prepare Frontend Environment:** Utilize the existing `multiverse-life-frontend` directory. Ensure `npm install` has been run and the project is ready for development.
2.  **Create Main Application Structure:** Set up the basic routing (if needed, otherwise a single-page app flow) and core components (e.g., `InputForm`, `ResultDisplay`).
3.  **Develop User Input Form:**
    *   Implement input fields for age, gender, major/job, personality, and current worries.
    *   Create a selection mechanism for the "what if" scenarios.
4.  **Design Placeholder Result Display:**
    *   Create a visually appealing layout for the simulated life story and data report.
    *   Include placeholders for dynamic text (job, salary, lifestyle, etc.) and visual elements (future appearance, environment).
    *   Design a simple timeline component.
    *   Implement a placeholder for the SNS shareable card image.
5.  **Stub Backend Integration:** Create a local JavaScript function that returns a dummy JSON object simulating the AI's response. This will allow the frontend to be fully functional and testable without a real backend.
6.  **Basic Styling:** Apply initial styling to match the modern, immersive, and responsive UI/UX principles outlined above, using CSS variables for theming.
7.  **Verify and Present:** Ensure the frontend is functional, visually appealing, and responsive. Provide instructions on how to run the application.

**Next Step:** I will begin by preparing the `multiverse-life-frontend` directory. I will first run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are set up, and then I will examine the project structure.
